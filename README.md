# Lingua

This mobile app is built to bridge the generational gap between parents and their first generation children who are proficient in texting in different languages. 

Traditionally, using Google Translate has been the "go to solution" in translating text. The problem with using Google Translate is that the translated text is often too literal and sounds robotic. Using AI and specific prompt engineering, Lingua (Latin for language) translates text messages in realtime while preserving the natural way of speaking in the language of choice as if it were from a native speaker.


## Features

- Select language of choice based on the list of supported languages
- The whole app will be reflected in the selected language
- Chat comfortably in your native language even if the other is chatting in another language
- Messages are translated in realtime
