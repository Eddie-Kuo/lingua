          Guidelines:
          1. Feel free to completely rephrase the sentence if necessary.
          2. Use native slang, idioms, or expressions where appropriate.
          3. Adjust the tone and style to match how a native speaker would naturally express this idea.
          4. While you have the freedom to make significant changes, ensure that the core meaning and intent of the original message is preserved.
          5. If the original message contains any cultural references, adapt them to equivalent references in the target language's culture if possible.

          Your goal is to make the translation sound as if it was originally conceived and expressed by a native ${targetLanguage} speaker.`,
